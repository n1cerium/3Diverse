# 3Diverse
3Diverse is an E-commerce site that displays some 3D items on the page, and the user can interact with the item such as rotating the item to get the view of the item in different angles. User can also add items on their cart for purchase. The app will then ask the user to enter their card information to confirm their purchase. User can also filter the 3D items by price or category. Lastly, before the users can select the items to be added to the cart or before buying the items, they must register for an account, first.
